## Security and protection

Security and protection means how a computer system with multiple users and processes needs to regulate access to data. It does this through mechanisms where only processes that have gained proper authorization from the operating system can operate on files, memory, CPU, and other resources.

Protection is important to control access and improve reliability by detecting interface errors. Security is also crucial to defend against external and internal attacks like viruses and identity theft.

The system needs to distinguish among users, using user IDs and group functionality. Privilege escalation allows users to gain extra permissions for specific activities.
